    Version 0.5

    - **Breaking Changes**
        * Changed the way routes are generated to match up with Flask
          documentation. index, post and custom methods without parameters
          are still configured with a trailing slash. put, patch, get,
          delete, and custom methods with parameters are configured without
          a trailing slash now.

        * Changed the way endpoints are generated to accommodate the more
          common cases. Methods with a single route are no longer have
          endpoints suffixed with an index.
          (Thanks to Jesaja Everling for the original patch.)

    - Features
        * Added support for specifying a custom endpoint using an endpoint
          keyword argument in the @route decorator.

    - Bugfixes
        * Fixed a bug that would not allow you to use any parameter name
          but "id" in the special methods.
